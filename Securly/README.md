# Main Folder
This is the main folder. It contains all of the source files extracted from the public .CRX file. I have throuroughly commented the code and formatted it. However, it WILL NOT BUILD AS-IS! The checksum will not match, so DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! This project is for research purposes only!

### Some important links:

 - conf.js - The config file for all of Securly.
